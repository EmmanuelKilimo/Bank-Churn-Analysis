## Project Title: Bank Customer Churn Classification

# Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to build a classification model to help the bank's product team
identify customers who are most likely to churn. Customer churn occurs when a
customer stops using a product or service. By predicting which customers are at the highest
risk of leaving, allowing the team to implement targeted retention strategies.

# Objectives:
1. Explore and analyze the dataset to gain initial insights (EDA).
2. Prepare the data for modeling, including cleaning and feature engineering.
3. Build and evaluate a logistic regression model to predict customer churn.
4. Develop and fine-tune a random forest model for improved predictive.
5. Provide best recommendations on customer retention.
